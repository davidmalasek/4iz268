			Timothy Donald Cook, born on November 1, 1960, is an American business
			executive and the current CEO of Apple Inc. Before becoming CEO, Cook
			served as Apple’s chief operating officer, working closely with the
			company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs. He joined Apple in March 1998 as senior
			vice president of worldwide operations, later advancing to executive vice
			president of worldwide sales and operations. On August 24, 2011, Cook was
			appointed CEO, succeeding Jobs, who resigned due to health issues and
			passed away later that year.
		</p>
		<p>
			During his time as CEO of Apple and a member of its board of directors,
			Tim Cook has been a vocal advocate for reforms in areas such as
			international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, national
			manufacturing, and environmental sustainability. Since becoming CEO, he
			has shifted Apple's management style from Steve Jobs's hands-on approach
			to a more collaborative culture.
		</p>
		<p>
			From 2011, when Cook took over, to 2020, he doubled Apple's revenue and
			profit, with the company's market value growing from $348 billion to $1.9
			trillion. By 2023, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue,
			generating $394.33 billion annually. Cook also serves on the boards of
			Nike, Inc. and the National Football Foundation, and is a trustee of Duke
			University, where he earned his degree.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of his work at Apple, Cook is involved in philanthropy. In March
			2015, he announced plans to donate his wealth to charity. In 2014, Cook
			became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to publicly come out as gay.
			Later that year, he was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor, where
			he addressed the state's track record on LGBT rights. This is the highest
			honor Alabama grants to its citizens. Cook was also named to Time's list
			of the 100 most influential people in the world in both 2012 and 2021.
